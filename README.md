# Analysis of On-Time Store Deliveries

## Overview:
Let’s dive in to narrow down some opportunities to improve on-time delivery to our grocery stores in the network.  Get back to being at an average of 90% or higher on a monthly basis.

## Problem Statement:
What are some things we can do to drive our on-time delivery percentage up?  We finished at 85% “not-late” for 2023, and it’s the 1st of February and seen little increase since late month.  The logistics analyst team has done some house cleaning to update their system and the stores’ master schedule with any inconsistence with the delivery time windows since the beginning of 2023.

## Data Acquisition:
Dispatching data from CAMs Prospero was pulled for the year 2023 to give some info on dispatching times, stop arrival times, minutes late, etc.  The master schedule was pulled as well to verify time window schedule in CAMs Prospero.

## Data Analysis:
The data pulled from CAMs ion .csv format was uploaded into MS Excel, where it was cleaned/prepped, sorted, used a few formulas and functions, summarized with pivot tables, analyzed and visualized.

## Key Insights:
Was able to identify eleven stores that were at an average of 20% or higher of receiving their delivery late during 2023.  Stores 195, 487, 391, 1402, 839, 2555, 2237, 622, 1299, 889, and 1155 are the ones we will focus on to improve.  Also, from validating delivery time windows in CAMs, a couple of stores were off from having the set two-hour window and had a set up for a 1-hour window.  This affected reporting for store to 756 to be hit as late for delivery of FRO and store 2631 for PER delivery.  We want to reduce that percentage to an average of 10% or less for each of those stores.

Of the average percentage of being delivered late to the listed stores, also you can see the average time of arrivals for each commodity…
                 

## Interpretation & Action Plan:
While the time window adjustment in the system for stores 756 & 2631, that will help improve the report of our on-time delivery as well as having to setup a meeting with the District Directors of the other 9 stores and get a buy-in on proposing to move the delivery time window an hour back or an hour ahead, based on the stores average arrival times.

##Limitations:
With data given, it does not accommodate for or present any bottlenecks from the warehouse of having the routes closed out and ready on time for dispatching.

## Follow-Up:
Once changes are implemented, we’ll circle back 30 days from the date of change to discover any improvement.  And if the improvement makes goal, continue again to reduce the late percentages.
